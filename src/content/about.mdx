export const meta = { title: "About Me" };

I’m Arvydas — a **frontend/Full-Stack** developer focused on clean architecture, accessible UI, and
fast, reliable DX. I enjoy React + TypeScript, .NET APIs, and building user-friendly, real-life solutions.
Looking for an **entry-level** role where I can learn fast and ship actual value.
